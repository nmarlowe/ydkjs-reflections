*** Values and types ***

values have types, variables do not.

Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, symbol.

*** Objects ***

Object = compound value with properties (named location) that each hold their own values

Property access = dot notation (obj.a , preferred when possible) or bracket notation (obj["a!"] , property name has special characters, requires variable or string literal, known as keys)

*** Arrays ***

More like a subtype of the object type.

Not named properties/keys, but numerically indexed.

*** Functions ***

Subtype of objects.

*** Built-in Type Methods ***

Built-in types and subtypes have behaviors (properties and methods.)

a.length, a.toUpperCase

*** Coercion ***

Explicit - The code (the programmer) converts type

Implicit - The engine converts type

*** Equality ***

== checks value
=== checks value and type
